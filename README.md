# Dune Case Study
This project explores Dune’s sales data from the previous business year to uncover insights, performance patterns, and opportunities for improvement. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), the study evaluates key sales metrics, customer behaviour, product performance, and regional trends, providing actionable recommendations to support strategic decisions aimed at boosting profitability and market growth. The analysis helps identify what drove sales success, where inefficiencies exist, and how to optimize future business performance using data-driven insights.

## Objectives

The main objectives of this case study were to:

* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Dune’s annual sales data.
* Identify top-performing products, regions, and sales representatives.
* Evaluate customer purchase patterns and order frequency.
* Detect underperforming categories or channels affecting revenue.
* Provide data-backed recommendations to improve business outcomes and profitability.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed transactional information from Dune’s sales records for the previous fiscal year, including:

* Product Details – Category, Sub-category, and Product ID
* Sales Metrics – Quantity Sold, Unit Price, Total Sales, and Profit
* Customer Information – Region, Customer Segment, and Sales Channel
* Order Details – Order Date, Month, and Sales Representative

Each record represents an individual sales transaction, enabling analysis of performance by time period, geography, and product segment.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process focused on uncovering sales drivers and identifying business opportunities through:

* Trend Analysis: Monthly and quarterly sales performance comparison.
* Profitability Insights: Evaluation of high- and low-margin products.
* Regional Insights: Comparing sales across territories or customer segments.
* Product Analysis: Identifying best- and worst-performing products.
* Customer Behaviour: Analysing repeat purchase patterns and customer value.

Visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps were used to communicate patterns and correlations effectively.

## Key Insights

* Top Products: Certain product categories consistently outperformed others, contributing most of the company’s total profit.
* Regional Performance: Specific regions generated higher sales volumes but lower profit margins, suggesting potential pricing or distribution inefficiencies.
* Seasonal Patterns: Sales peaked in certain months, indicating opportunities for targeted promotions during low-demand periods.
* Customer Segments: A small percentage of repeat customers contributed significantly to revenue — emphasizing the value of retention programs.
* Profitability Gaps: Some high-volume items recorded low profit margins, signalling the need for margin optimization and product cost review.

## Recommendations

1. Focus on High-Margin Products
   * Prioritize products with strong profit contributions in marketing and inventory planning.

2. Revisit Pricing Strategies
   * Review pricing models for low-margin products or regions to improve overall profitability.

3. Customer Retention Programs
   * Develop loyalty or referral incentives to retain high-value repeat customers.

4. Seasonal Campaign Optimization
   * Align promotions and discount strategies with months showing seasonal dips in sales.

5. Data-Driven Regional Strategy
   * Reassess logistics and supply chain efficiency in regions with high sales but low profits.

## Future Work

* Integrate predictive analytics to forecast future sales trends.
* Build interactive dashboards using Power BI or Tableau for real-time tracking.
* Apply segmentation models to personalize marketing for different customer groups.

## Tech Stack Summary

* Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook
* Analysis Type: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
